# Formespree Demo:
This is very handy tool to use, all you have to do is sign up for "formspree" and then you can copy and paste whicever code you are looking for into your VS code or whichever platform you are using. But don't forget to make it proper HTML by add your "!DOCTYPE". After doing this i just linked my email to my page and that way now i will be able to get the submissions from the people that need to contact me.
